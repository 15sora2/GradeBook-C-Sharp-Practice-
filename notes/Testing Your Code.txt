****The Many Benefits of Unit Testing****
--> Verify behavior of code
--> Investigate what would make the code go wrong and where
--> Testing small units/portions of code
--> Automate testing so we don't run the code each time
         to check functionality

****Creating A Unit Test Project****
-->Create a test folder
-->dotnet new xunit
-->xUnit comes from NuGet

****Writting and Running A Test****
-->[Fact]
    -->An Attribute
    -->A piece of data that is attached to the Test method
-->Can run tests from the command line using dotnet test
-->Test Runner

****Referencing Projects and Packages****
-->



using System;
using Xunit;

namespace GradeBook.Tests
{
    public class BookTests
    {
        [Fact]
        //An attribute
        public void Test1()
        {
            //arrange
            var book = new Book("");
            book.AddGrade(89.1);
            book.AddGrade(90.5);
            book.AddGrade(77.3);

            //act
            var result = book.GetStatistics();
            
            //assert
            Assert.Equal(85.6, result.Average);
            Assert.Equal(90.5, result.High);
            Assert.Equal(77.3, result.Low);
        }
    }
